## Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. This project aims to harness the power of machine learning to predict passenger survival based on the available data. By utilizing TensorFlow's Linear Regression, we can create a predictive model that provides insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival.

## Installation

To get started with the Titanic Survival Predictor, you'll need to follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unmeshsagar/TitanicSurivalPredictor-TFLinearRegression.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd TitanicSurivalPredictor-TFLinearRegression/app
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib
```

That's it! You're now ready to use the Titanic Survival Predictor.


## Data

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes for each passenger, including:

- **Age**: The age of the passenger.
- **Sex**: The gender of the passenger.
- **Class**: The class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) in which the passenger traveled.
- **Fare**: The fare paid by the passenger for the ticket.
- **Survival Status**: The target variable, indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).


## Model

The Titanic Survival Predictor employs TensorFlow's Linear Regression model. Linear Regression is a powerful algorithm that establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. It's an excellent choice for predicting numerical values, making it suitable for this survival prediction task.
